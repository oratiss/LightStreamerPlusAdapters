HOW TO UPGRADE LIGHTSTREAMER
============================

First of all, please see CHANGELOG.HTML to know all the differences from
the previous versions of the Lightstreamer Server components.


------------------------------------
Upgrading from 7.1.2 to This Version
------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 7.1.2,
then this new release brings various improvements and a few bug fixes
in the Server and related SDKs (ARI, JMX, TLCP) and the MPN Module.
In particular, the Adapter Remoting Infrastructure is now fully embedded
in the Server and it is no longer versioned separately. Hence the
Remote Adapter SDKs now must express their compatibility with respect
to the Server version directly.

However, the Server improvements also involve a change in many
of the deployed third-party libraries.
So, we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.2.0, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  The configuration files under the "conf" folder
  (e.g. lightstreamer_conf.xml, lightstreamer_log_conf.xml) can be copied
  in the new installation unchanged, but for a few corner cases.
  To prevent these cases and to take advantage of new configuration
  opportunities, we suggest you to rather take note of any changes you
  performed and apply them to the new factory files.
  For lightstreamer_conf.xml and lightstreamer_log_conf.xml, you can
  also use the online Configuration File Upgrade Tool, available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  As for the configuration files under the "conf/mpn" folder, you can
  copy them unchanged in the new installation. However, if you had to
  customize the "Device.hbm.xml" file, then you should rather take note
  of the changes you performed and apply them to the new factory file.

  On the other hand, if you have changed the launch scripts under "bin"
  (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat), take note of any changes you performed and apply
  them to the new factory files.

  Also consider that if you run the Server with a license of "file" type,
  a license upgrade may be needed.

- ADAPTERS:
  The Server upgrade to 7.2.0 is still associated with SDK for Java
  In-Process Adapters version 7.3.0, whereas the embedded Adapter
  Remoting Infrastructure has moved to ARI Protocol version 1.8.3,
  but with backward compatibility.
  So, you can deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged, in regard
  to both Java In-Process and Remote Adapters.

  However, if you use Remote Adapters, your adapters.xml files should
  be revised according with the Server CHANGELOG. To simplify the
  operation, we suggest you using the online Configuration File
  Upgrade Tool; it is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  Note that all the Remote Adapter SDKs have changed recently. On the
  download page you can find the current versions of the SDKs.
  In order to upgrade the adapters, read carefully through the CHANGELOG
  of the involved SDKs to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with all client libraries available at the time
  of release and with all previous client libraries, so your existing
  clients should work with no issues.

  Some of the client SDKs may have changed recently. On the download page
  you can find the current versions of the SDKs.
  In order to upgrade the clients, read carefully through the CHANGELOG
  of the involved SDKs to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

  The Server upgrade to 7.2.0 also implies the upgrade of the SDK for
  JMX Extensions to version 5.6.0, with only a few changes and extensions,
  but see the CHANGELOG of the JMX SDK, that you can find on the download
  page, to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  If leveraging the MPN module, you can deploy your existing database
  unchanged on the new installation.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 7.1.1 build 20200527 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 7.1.1 build 20200527,
then this new release brings various improvements and a few bug fixes
in the Server and related SDKs (ARI, JMX, TLCP) and the MPN Module.
In particular, the Adapter Remoting Infrastructure is now fully embedded
in the Server and it is no longer versioned separately. Hence the
Remote Adapter SDKs now must express their compatibility with respect
to the Server version directly.

More significantly, the new release no longer includes the resources
of the various SDKs in the distribution package. Now Client and Adapter
SDKs evolve independently and their resources, including the CHANGELOG,
can only be reached directly from the download page.
Moreover, the Server improvements also involve a change in many
of the deployed third-party libraries.
So, we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.2.0, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  The configuration files under the "conf" folder
  (e.g. lightstreamer_conf.xml, lightstreamer_log_conf.xml) can be copied
  in the new installation unchanged, but for a few corner cases.
  To prevent these cases and to take advantage of new configuration
  opportunities, we suggest you to rather take note of any changes you
  performed and apply them to the new factory files.
  For lightstreamer_conf.xml and lightstreamer_log_conf.xml, you can
  also use the online Configuration File Upgrade Tool, available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  As for the configuration files under the "conf/mpn" folder, you can
  copy them unchanged in the new installation. However, if you had to
  customize the "Device.hbm.xml" file, then you should rather take note
  of the changes you performed and apply them to the new factory file.

  On the other hand, if you have changed the launch scripts under "bin"
  (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat), take note of any changes you performed and apply
  them to the new factory files.

  Also consider that if you run the Server with a license of "file" type,
  a license upgrade may be needed.

- ADAPTERS:
  The Server upgrade to 7.2.0 also implies the upgrade of the SDK for
  Java In-Process Adapters to version 7.3.0, with no significant changes,
  whereas the embedded Adapter Remoting Infrastructure has moved to ARI
  Protocol version 1.8.3, but with backward compatibility.
  So, you can deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged, in regard
  to both Java In-Process and Remote Adapters.

  However, if you use Remote Adapters, your adapters.xml files should
  be revised according with the Server CHANGELOG. To simplify the
  operation, we suggest you using the online Configuration File
  Upgrade Tool; it is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  Note that all the Remote Adapter SDKs have changed recently. On the
  download page you can find the current versions of the SDKs.
  In order to upgrade the adapters, read carefully through the CHANGELOG
  of the involved SDKs to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with all client libraries available at the time
  of release and with all previous client libraries, so your existing

  The Server upgrade to 7.2.0 also implies the upgrade of the SDK for
  JMX Extensions to version 5.6.0, with only a few changes and extensions,
  but see the CHANGELOG of the JMX SDK, that you can find on the download
  page, to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  If leveraging the MPN module, you can deploy your existing database
  unchanged on the new installation.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 7.1.0 build 20200124 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 7.1.0 build 20200124,
then this new release brings various improvements and a few bug fixes
in the Server and related SDKs (ARI, JMX, TLCP) and the MPN Module.

Moreover, the Server improvements also involve new deployed third-party
libraries and changes in many others.
So, we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.2.0, then:

- CONFIGURATION:

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  If leveraging the MPN module, you can deploy your existing database
  unchanged on the new installation.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 7.0.3 build 20190107 to This Version
Upgrading from 7.0.2 build 20181003 to This Version
Upgrading from 7.0.1 build 20180614 to This Version
Upgrading from 7.0.0 build 20180228 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 7.0.0 build 20180228
through 7.0.3 build 20190107, then this new release brings various
improvements and bug fixes in the Server and related SDKs (ARI, JMX, TLCP).
In particular, the Adapter Remoting Infrastructure is now fully embedded
in the Server and it is no longer versioned separately. Hence the
Remote Adapter SDKs now must express their compatibility with respect
to the Server version directly.

More significantly, the new release no longer includes the resources
of the various SDKs in the distribution package. Now Client and Adapter
SDKs evolve independently and their resources, including the CHANGELOG,
can only be reached directly from the download page.
The release also brings an upgrade of the Server's MPN Module implementation.
Moreover, the Server improvements also involve new deployed third-party
libraries and changes in many others.
So, we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.2.0, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  The configuration files under the "conf" folder
  (e.g. lightstreamer_conf.xml, lightstreamer_log_conf.xml) can be copied
  in the new installation unchanged, but for a few corner cases.
  To prevent these cases and to take advantage of new configuration
  opportunities, we suggest you to rather take note of any changes you
  performed and apply them to the new factory files.
  For lightstreamer_conf.xml and lightstreamer_log_conf.xml, a better option
  is to use the online Configuration File Upgrade Tool, available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  If you are leveraging the MPN Module, the MPN related configuration files
  under the "conf/mpn" folder should be ported manually according with
  the Server CHANGELOG.

  If you are leveraging the possibility to define custom extensions to the
  logging subsystem, the deployment of such extensions may need to be modified
  according with the Server CHANGELOG.

  On the other hand, if you have changed the launch scripts under "bin"
  (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat), take note of any changes you performed and apply
  them to the new factory files.

  Also consider that if you run the Server with a license of "file" type,
  a license upgrade may be needed.

- ADAPTERS:
  The Server upgrade to 7.2.0 also implies the upgrade of the SDK for
  Java In-Process Adapters to version 7.3.0,
  whereas the embedded Adapter Remoting Infrastructure has moved to ARI
  Protocol version 1.8.3, but with backward compatibility.

  You should be able to deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged,
  but first check for possible corner cases in the CHANGELOG of the
  Java In-Process Adapter SDK (or in the Sever CHANGELOG for Remote
  Adapters).

  However, if you use Remote Adapters, your adapters.xml files should
  also be revised according with the Server CHANGELOG. To simplify the
  operation, we suggest you using the online Configuration File
  Upgrade Tool; it is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  Note that the Remote Adapter SDKs have changed significantly. On the
  download page you can find the currently available SDKs and their
  versions.
  In order to upgrade the In-Process and Remote Adapters to newer SDK
  versions, read carefully through the CHANGELOG of the involved SDKs
  to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with all client libraries available at the time
  of release and with all previous client libraries, so your existing
  clients should work with no issues.
  The only exception regards Android clients leveraging the MPN support;
  see paragraph "Special Considerations on the GCM to FCM Transition" in the
  General Concepts document for clarifications.

  Note that the Client SDKs have changed significantly. On the download
  page you can find the currently available SDKs and their versions.
  In order to upgrade the Clients to newer SDK versions, read carefully
  through the CHANGELOG of the involved SDKs to learn about any possible
  compatibility issues. In particular, if you run the Server with a license
  of "file" type, a license upgrade may be needed.

  The Server upgrade to 7.2.0 also implies the upgrade of the SDK for
  JMX Extensions to version 5.6.0, with various changes and extensions;
  see the CHANGELOG of the JMX SDK, that you can find on the download
  page, to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  If leveraging the MPN module, and the GCM service in particular, then the
  database contents should be migrated when ported to the new Server.
  To achieve that, please contact Lightstreamer support for instructions.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 6.1.0 build 20170123 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 6.1.0 build 20170123,
then this new release brings a brand new licensing mechanism, a wholly
revised MPN module and various improvements and bug fixes in the Server
and related SDKs (ARI, JMX, TLCP).
In particular, the Adapter Remoting Infrastructure is now fully embedded
in the Server and it is no longer versioned separately. Hence the
Remote Adapter SDKs now must express their compatibility with respect
to the Server version directly.

More significantly, the new release no longer includes the resources
of the various SDKs in the distribution package. Now Client and Adapter
SDKs evolve independently and their resources, including the CHANGELOG,
can only be reached directly from the download page.
Moreover, the Server improvements also involve new deployed third-party
libraries and changes in many others.

However, if you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer Moderato 6.1.0
build 20170123 and are upgrading to this release by leveraging the Community
edition, then the new release also brings the support for many client SDKs;
all the SDKs shown in the download page are now available, although only
one of which can be activated. It also brings several features that
previously were hidden, but that are still unavailable.

So, we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.2.0, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  The lightstreamer_version_conf.xml file was replaced by the brand
  new lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml.
  Since license configuration was totally revised, you need to pass through
  the new file to configure properly the Lightstreamer Edition and License
  Type, according with your current contractual terms.
  Moreover, any changes you performed in lightstreamer_version_conf.xml
  to the <proxy> block and the <audit_log_path>, <automatic_update_check>,
  and <automatic_audit_upload> elements should also be applied to
  lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml.

  Take note of the changes you performed on the other configuration files under
  the "conf" folder (e.g. lightstreamer_conf.xml, lightstreamer_log_conf.xml)
  and apply your changes to the new factory configuration files.
  Do the same for the launch scripts under "bin" (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat).
  For lightstreamer_conf.xml and lightstreamer_log_conf.xml, this may not be
  easy, so we suggest you using the online Configuration File Upgrade Tool;
  it is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  However, if you are leveraging the MPN module, hence
  you have modified the <mpn> block in lightstreamer_conf.xml and the files
  under "conf/mpn", please contact Lightstreamer support for further
  instructions.

  If you are leveraging the possibility to define custom extensions to the
  logging subsystem, the deployment of such extensions may need to be modified
  according with the Server CHANGELOG.

- ADAPTERS:
  The Server upgrade to 7.2.0 also implies the upgrade of the SDK for
  Java In-Process Adapters to version 7.3.0,
  whereas the embedded Adapter Remoting Infrastructure has moved to ARI
  Protocol version 1.8.3, with some breaking changes.

  Your adapters.xml files should be revised according with the CHANGELOG
  of the Java In-Process Adapter SDK (or the Sever CHANGELOG for Remote
  Adapters). To simplify the operation, we suggest you using the online
  Configuration File Upgrade Tool; it is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  After that, and unless the MPN module is involved, you should be able
  to deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged, but first check for
  possible corner cases in the CHANGELOG of the Java In-Process Adapter SDK
  (or in the Sever CHANGELOG for Remote Adapters).
  If leveraging the MPN module, please read carefully through the relevant
  CHANGELOG for all the details changed.

  Note that the Remote Adapter SDKs have changed significantly. On the
  download page you can find the currently available SDKs and their
  versions.
  In order to upgrade the In-Process and Remote Adapters to newer SDK
  versions, read carefully through the CHANGELOG of the involved SDKs
  to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with all client libraries available at the time
  of release and with all previous client libraries, so your existing
  clients should work with no issues.
  However, if leveraging the MPN module (possible with some
  old client SDKs), consider that the support for Push Notifications on such
  old clients has been dropped and all client requests will be refused by the
  new Server. In that case, a porting to the newest client SDK will be needed.

  Note that the Client SDKs have changed significantly. On the download
  page you can find the currently available SDKs and their versions.
  In order to upgrade the Clients to newer SDK versions, read carefully through
  the CHANGELOG of the involved SDKs to learn about any possible compatibility
  issues and if you need to recompile your code. In particular, if you run the
  Server with a license of "file" type, a license upgrade may be needed.

  The Server upgrade to 7.2.0 also implies the upgrade of the SDK for
  JMX Extensions to version 5.6.0, with various changes and extensions;
  see the CHANGELOG of the JMX SDK, that you can find on the download
  page, to learn about any possible compatibility issues.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  If leveraging the MPN module, the database should be migrated when ported
  to the new Server. To achieve that, please contact Lightstreamer support
  for instructions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from all Previous Versions (before 6.1) to This Version
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Port your installation to version 6.1.0 first, by downloading the 6.1.0
package and following the provided upgrade instructions. Then you can proceed
by referring to the instructions for 6.1.0 above.

Note that, if you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer Moderato
and are upgrading to this release by leveraging the Community edition,
then in the first step you should upgrade to Lightstreamer Moderato 6.1.0.
